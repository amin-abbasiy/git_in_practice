# Concept

## Local Git

Git repositories store all their data on your local machine. Making commits, view-
ing history, and requesting differences between commits are all local operations that
donâ€™t require a network connection.

    $ find .

Event Hooks: shows event hook samples (scripts that run on defined events). For example, pre-
commit is run before every new commit is made.
